Locate files or folders in Solution Explorer
===

A plugin for ReSharper 8 that allows you to quickly lookup any file or folder in your solution, but without opening it.

This allows for uninterrupted workflow of going to a particular location in the solution explorer (perhaps to add a new file), but without opening an arbitrary file in that location.

Invoked via **double Shift-Alt-L** - you will be presented with a dialog similar to Go to File:

![Locate file in Solution Explorer][1]

After selecting the file, it will be located and highlighted in the Solution Explorer, but without opening it.

![Located file][2]

---

To install, simply get [**ReSharper.LocateFileInSolutionExplorer**](https://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com/packages/ReSharper.LocateFileInSolutionExplorer) package from ReSharper's [Extensions Gallery](http://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com/).

ReSharper 8.1 or later required.
